# Welcome to the LightRL Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **LightRL**, a lightweight Reinforcement Learning python library.

## Overview

LightRL is designed to be lightweight and easy to use for problems developers are dealing with often. There are other libraries that you might find useful, but often too extensive and complex for the simple usecases, namely [openai/gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) and [facebookresearch/ReAgent](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ReAgent).

## Getting Started

To start using LightRL, check out the following resources:

- **[Quick Start](quickstart.md)**: Installation and minimal example.
- **[Examples](examples.md)**: At the moment one example for online optimization of API calls.
- **[API Documentation](api.md)**: Detailed information on the API and available functions.

LightRL is licensed under the [MIT License](license.md), ensuring that it remains free and open-source.
